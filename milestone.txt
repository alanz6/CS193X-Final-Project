CS193X Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: Music Recommendation App
Your Name: Alan Zhang
Your SUNetID: alanzal

Overview
--------
I have designed how the data storing process and API would look like. I have a good idea
of what the front end will look like visually.

Project Changes
---------------
I decided to change the structure of the project into more of a social media app that allows
users to share music reommendations in a fixed format (ex. song name + artist). The app would specialize in music recommendation/sharing.

Implementation Details
----------------------
Each user's follower information will be stored in MongoDB. Each time the user recommends a song on the app,
this recommendation would also be stored in MongoDB. In terms of front-end, the user
would be able to type in the song name and artist name in text inputs and press a button
to share a song rec to all followers.
