CS193X Final Project
====================

Project Title: My Top Artists
Your Name: Alan Zhang
Your SUNetID: alanzal

Overview
--------
It allows each user to keep a list of their favourite music artists. The currently logged-in user can edit
their list whenenver by removing/adding artists. Also, users can search for other users
to see their lists. Finally, the website will be able to return a list of all the users, 
sorted based on the number of shared top artists with the currently logged-in user.

Running
-------

Do we need to load data from init_db.mongodb? Yes (It just resets the database)

Features
--------

Type in a username and either log in as that user or search for that user.
If you log in, you can edit your current list of top artists. You
can also press the "Find Similar Users" button in order to see a list of all the users, sorted
based on how many shared top artists they have with you.
If you are searching for a user (who is not the currently logged-in user), you can
see their list but you won't be able to edit it.
